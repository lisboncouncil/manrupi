# Very occasionally the user will run into this error when logging in, either because
# the redirects from B2C aren't working correctly, or the user's browser doesn't have
# a cookie set, or their session doesn't have the relevant oauth values stored.
# The exact cause is currently unknown and hard to pin down due to the transient
# nature of the bug.
# Because the login invariably works the next time the user tries, this workaround
# just presents the OIDC login button again (labelled as a 'continue' button...) and
# will thus allow them to login successfully. In theory.
