# Administrator tasks

This section of the manual aims to help you understand how to perform tasks as an Administrator of your WasteWorks service. 

If you find that you cannot perform any of the tasks detailed below when logged into your WasteWorks account, it is likely that your account has not been given the relevant permissions or role.

Contact your account Administrator to request these permissions. 

Accompanying each task covered in this document, you will see ‘permissions required’, listing the permissions an Administrator must give you (either individually or via a role) for you to be able to perform this task.

Please also note that there may be small differences in the way WasteWorks functions for different councils depending on how you use the service, the integration(s) you have selected, and the individual processes reflected in your workflow.

Please speak to your Administrator if you have questions about functionality not covered specfically in the below guidance. If you are the Administrator and you need extra help, please open a ticket on Freshdesk.

## Further help

- If you’re a member of council staff using WasteWorks, questions about your account, role or permissions should be addressed to your Administrator.
- For any technical problems and queries, Administrators may contact the SocietyWorks team by raising a ticket through the helpdesk system.
