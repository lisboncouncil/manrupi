  <h2>Why does my council not accept reports from FixMyStreet?</h2>
  <p>There may be several reasons for councils refusing to accept reports from third parties like FixMyStreet.
  We built FixMyStreet to make it easier for citizens to report problems without needing to have any knowledge of council boundaries or responsibilities.
