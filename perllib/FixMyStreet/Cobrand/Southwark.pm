=head2 lookup_site_code

Reports sent to Confirm have a "site code" which is usually the USRN of the
street they're on. For reports made within estates Southwark don't want the
street USRN to be used, but rather the site code of the estate.

This code ensures the estate site code is used even if the report was made
on a street that happens to be within an estate.

=cut

sub lookup_site_code {
    my $self = shift;
    my $row = shift;
    my $field = shift;

    if (my $feature = $self->estate_feature_for_point($row->latitude, $row->longitude)) {
        return $feature->{properties}->{Site_code};
    }

    return $self->SUPER::lookup_site_code($row, $field);
}


=head2 lookup_site_code_config

When looking up the USRN of a street where a report was made, numbered roads within
Southwark must be ignored as Southwark's Confirm system is setup to reject
reports made on such streets. The majority of these street features actually
have an overlapping named road which will be found and used instead.

=cut

    my $host = FixMyStreet->config('STAGING_SITE') ? "tilma.staging.mysociety.org" : "tilma.mysociety.org";

=head2 estate_feature_for_point

Takes a coordinate (as latitude & longitude) and queries the Southwark Estates
asset layer on our tilma WFS server to determine whether the coordinate lies
within an estate. If it does, the feature is returned.

=head2 category_groups_to_skip

Southwark do not want certain TfL categories to appear, dependent on
whether an 'estates' or 'street' area has been selected

=cut

    return {
        estates => [

            'River Piers',
        ],
    };
}


=head2 munge_categories

Southwark have two distinct sets of categories that are shown to the user
depending on whether the report they're making is inside or outside an estate.

Categories for estates have service codes that start with HOU_, and street
categories start with STCL_.

Some additional filtering is done on top of that to remove some TfL categories,
as determined by C<category_groups_to_skip>.

=cut

sub munge_categories {
    my ( $self, $contacts ) = @_;

    if ( $self->report_new_is_in_estate ) {
        @$contacts = grep {
            $_->email !~ /^STCL_/;
        } @$contacts;

        @$contacts = _filter_categories_by_group( $contacts, 'estates' );
    } else {
        @$contacts = grep {
            $_->email !~ /^HOU_/;
        } @$contacts;

        @$contacts = _filter_categories_by_group( $contacts, 'street' );
    }
}


=head2 _filter_categories_by_group

Returns an array of contacts that have some TfL categories removed, according
to the list specified in C<category_groups_to_skip>.

=cut

    # $area_type is either 'estates' or 'street'
