You can report cases of fly-tipping on private land to us, although it is the landowner’s responsibility to clear the waste.

Our Environmental Enforcement Team can only investigate if there is enough evidence available, e.g. witness statement, CCTV footage, evidence in the waste, etc.
When you report, please state if you’re able to provide any evidence to support our investigation.

If there is enough evidence, once the case is referred to the Environmental Enforcement Team for investigation, we will mark the report as closed on the system.

If there is no evidence of the fly-tipping being committed, or who the waste originally belonged to, we are unable to investigate and proceed with your report.
