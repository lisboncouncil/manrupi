    <dt>What is this site?</dt>
    <dd>[% site_name %] is a Home Office funded pilot enabling antisocial behaviour
    offenders an opportunity to make good the damage caused by contributing to
    environmental improvements.<br><br>
    This [% site_name %] site seeks to give victims and residents a voice in
    identifying locations where antisocial behaviour offenders can help make
    environmental improvements to their local communities (e.g. graffiti removal) by
    simply locating them on a map. Submissions made without a photograph are
    unlikely to be suitable for this scheme.<br><br>
    The [% site_name %] team will risk-assess each submission and where
    referrals are not suitable for the scheme, they will be forwarded to the relevant
    local authority.<br><br>
    If you witness antisocial behaviour in action, this should be reported, as normal,
    directly to Nottinghamshire Police on 101 or your relevant local council.</dd>

<dl>
    <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
    <dd>The [% site_name %] Team is not responsible for the content and accuracy of
    material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
    problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being
    informed by a user of the site.</dd>

    <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
    <dd>We want to keep [% site_name %] locally focused, so restrict the ability to
    move radically between areas. The map on Your Reports will let you see all the
    reports you&rsquo;ve made, wherever they are. If you&rsquo;re from the authority then the
    emailed version of the problem report might also contain the closest road or
    postcode to the pin on the map.</dd>
