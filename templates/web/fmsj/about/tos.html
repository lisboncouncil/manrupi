<h1>Condition of Use</h1>

<p>Man Rūpi is a web service made available to the public and the authorities to report incidents in public spaces. On the other hand, it is not a valid tool for reporting personal facts or facts about specific persons, political opinions, appreciations or criticism of the administration and its work in general (there are other spaces for this). So, please keep your reports and updates civil, tasteful and relevant. </p>
<p>The Man Rüpi staff, including the Jonava administration and the Lisbon Council working group, reserve the right to remove from publication without notice any report or comment that contravenes the spirit of this platform. </p>
<p>Severe and/or repeated abuse may result in account suspension at the sole discretion of the Man Rupi staff, up to and including reporting to the authorities.</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of behaviour considered inappropriate is as follows : </p>
<ul>
<li>No defamatory comments. A defamatory comment is one that can damage the reputation of a person or organisation. If successfully sued, you could be held liable for considerable damages and costs.</li>
<li>Do not implicate other people in your reports. Man Rūpi should not be used for reports that implicate a person; you should never identify anyone as a wrongdoer by name, description or address. Reports about anti-social behaviour, animal cruelty, parking offences, criminal activity etc should not be reported on Man Rūpi - you’ll often find that your council has a hotline for these types of issues, or it may be better to report them directly to the police.</li>
<li>Do not post messages that are unlawful, harassing, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harmful, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, homophobic or racially offensive.</li>
<li>Do not impersonate other people. Reports or comments deliberately intended to look as though they are coming from someone else may leave you liable to defamation law.</li>
<li>Do not use the website as a place to air personal grievances about other people or organisations.</li>
<li>No swearing. People of all backgrounds read and contribute to Man Rūpi. Please don’t use profanities or other words which might offend them.</li>
<li>No spamming or flooding. </li>
<li>Don’t repost the same message, or very similar messages, more than once.</li>

</ul>
<p>Be aware that Man Rūpi reports and updates are displayed publicly on the website. For this reason, please do not include personal details such as your (or another person’s) address or telephone number in your initial report - these can be provided in your personal details so that the council can get in touch with you. This is for your own safety and that of everyone who uses this service. All reports and updates can be made anonymously by unticking the ‘Display my name publicly’ box.</p>
<p>Talk to other people online with the same degree of civility as you would offline. Man Rūpi does allow for anonymous commenting but anonymity should never be used as a cover for inappropriate or abusive comments.</p>
