# The resident’s experience

This section of the user manual aims to help you understand how WasteWorks works from the resident’s point of view. Staff users making reports, requests, bookings or cancellations on behalf of residents have the same user experience. 

## Important notice

This guide provides a **general overview** of each of WasteWorks' standard resident-facing features. There may be small differences in how the software functions for different councils, depending on how you use the service, the integration(s) you have selected, and the individual processes reflected in your workflow. 

Please speak to your Administrator if you have questions about functionality not covered specfically in the below guidance. If you are the Administrator and you need extra help, please open a ticket on Freshdesk.

### Checking your bin day

WasteWorks’ start page invites the resident to search for the location of their property by entering a postcode. 

They can then select an address from the dropdown menu. Once selected, WasteWorks will display all existing collections associated with the selected property and any available information from your integrated in-cab system attached to them.

### Downloading your bin schedule

Bin day collection schedules can be downloaded from the site by selecting ‘Download your collection schedule’ from the menu on the right-hand side. 

Residents can also add schedules to their calendar. These will update automatically whenever you make a change to the schedule.

### Requesting a new or extra container

From the main ‘Your bin days’ page, residents can select ‘Request a new container’ from the ‘More services’ menu. 

They can also find a link to request a new container beneath each available bin collection listed on the main page.

<img alt="Requesting a new bin" src="/assets/img/ww-user-guide/WasteWorks-request-new-container-resident-experience.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

First, users select the type of container they want to request and how many they need.

<img alt="Select container" src="/assets/img/ww-user-guide/WasteWorks-select-container-resident-experience.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

If enabled/required by your processes, you can include a step to gather information on why a new or extra container is required.

<img alt="Reasons for new container request" src="/assets/img/ww-user-guide/WasteWorks%20requesting%20new%20or%20extra%20container.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

The user will then be asked for some basic contact information which they can review before submitting the request.

### Reporting a missed collection

To report a missed collection, from the main ‘Your bin days’ page the resident will be asked to select the bin/collection in question and provide their contact details so that updates can be provided. 

They can also find a link to report a missed collection beneath each available bin collection listed on the main page.

<img alt="Report a missed collection" src="/assets/img/ww-user-guide/WasteWorks-report-missed-collection.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

The user will provide information on the missed collection which they will be able to review before submitting the report.

**Please note:** If available from your integrated system, WasteWorks can display updates relating to specific collections which can pre-empt and avoid unnecessary missed collection reports (e.g. you can explain that a collection is running late) or disable the form in appropriate circumstances (e.g. if it's logged in the in-cab system that the bin was not presented, and therefore the collection was not missed).
