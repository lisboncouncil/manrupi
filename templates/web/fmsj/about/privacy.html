<p>Any rectifications or erasures of data requested must be notified, by the data controller, within one month of the request being submitted, to the user as well as to those persons to whom the incorrect, incomplete and irrelevant data were forwarded, unless notification to these recipients proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.</p>

<p>The user also has a right of effective judicial remedy regarding certain acts and decisions of the supervisory authority when it renders a legally binding decision or when it fails to inform the user within three months of the progress or outcome of their complaint.</p>
