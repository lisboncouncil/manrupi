I am happy to announce the release of **version 6.0** of FixMyStreet.

Some features in this release include:

* The ability to add a category filter to the reporting process, letting people search for a particular category. (This involves adding a 
`category_filter.html` template to your cobrand, similar to the
[one used on fixmystreet.com](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/blob/e663749a078/templates/web/fixmystreet.com/report/new/category_filter.html).)

* Improved display of the filters on map pages:

* A new geolocation button to centre the map at your location:

* Adding the report ID reference to lists of reports in emails:

* We redirect to a confirmation page when creating a report, reducing the risk of Safari creating a duplicate report
* Cobrands can have different map display times for open/closed/fixed reports
* All uploaded images are now converted to JPEGs
* Users can opt out of questionnaires

### Admin improvements

We have improved the navigation in the admin, moving the main navigation to a sidebar.
This is accompanied by minor display and performance improvements in various admin pages.

Extra questions can now be multiple-choice using checkboxes, or a datetime picker, in addition
to the existing options of text field, textarea, and single value. You can also
make a phone number required for a particular category.

On the dashboard, you can now filter by multiple categories, and we've fixed
the CSV export to not ignore reports that had updates that were only
unconfirmed or hidden.

A long standing bug viewing a category when it has more than 1,000 history entries has been fixed.

### Development improvement examples

* FixMyStreet has been around for a long time, and implemented its own way of sorting extra data
on a per-report or update basis. Since then, PostgreSQL has added JSON support, and we have now
moved the database tables to store data in this standard way.
* The site can now automatically spot a favicon.ico file present in the
`web/cobrands/<your-cobrand>` directory, rather than having to add your own
header template.
* Cobrands can provide (optionally per-category) custom distances for duplicate lookups
* The daemon will deal with waiting reports in a random order

### Upgrading

A full list of changes can be seen in the
[v6.0 changelog](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/releases/tag/v6.0)
as usual.
