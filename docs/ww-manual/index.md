## What is WasteWorks?

WasteWorks is a user-centred front-end residential waste service designed in collaboration with Bromley Council for local authorities.

The solution simplifies access to all aspects of waste online, bringing everything together to improve the user experience and reduce unnecessary contact to the council.

## History and background

Launched in 2021, its intuitive, self-service-style workflow is based upon FixMyStreet Pro, SocietyWorksâ€™ original, well-loved reporting service for street, highways and environment issues, which launched in 2012.

Being a long-term user of FixMyStreet Pro, Bromley Council shared our desire to bring the usability of FixMyStreet Pro to waste services, wanting to provide residents with an easier way to make waste-related reports, requests and payments all from one place.

Similarly to FixMyStreet Pro, WasteWorks integrates with in-cab systems, facilitating a two-way flow of data between council and resident, as well as helping to streamline processes without adding any complexity for residents.

WasteWorks was shortlisted for an LGC Award within its first year of launch.
