Changes to collections of upholstered seating items

Due to new regulations, collections of upholstered seating items like armchairs, sofas, footstools, bean bags and cushions will take place separately from other items. There is no change to the way you request a bulky waste collection. However, some items may be collected separately at a different time, which could be up to two working days after your scheduled collection day.

If you live in a house: Make sure items are accessible and clearly visible from the front of your house, as close to the pavement as possible without being on it.

If you live in a block of flats: Put your items next to the bin store area (not inside it) on the morning of your collection.
