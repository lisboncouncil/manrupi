or report ones of your own by clicking on the map at the location of
the problem.</dd>
        <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
        <dd>They are reported directly to us so we can then resolve the problem.
        You can also discuss the problem on the website with others if you wish.</dd>

        <dt>Do you remove inappropriate or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>Hart District Council and FixMyStreet are not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>

            the [% c.cobrand.council_name %] reporting app</a>.
    </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I use these pages to report problems outside of the Hart District?</dd>

    <dt>The site is powered by FixMyStreet, who are they?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet was built by <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.youngfoundation.org/">Young Foundation</a>. 
mySociety is a registered charity, number 1076346, which has grown out of the community of
volunteers who built sites like <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a>. 
mySociety&rsquo;s primary mission is to build Internet projects which give people simple, tangible
benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. mySociety
can be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:hello&#64;mysociety.org">hello&#64;mysociety.org</a>,
or by post at mySociety, 483 Green Lanes, London, N13 4BS.</dd>

    <dt>Why does the site use kilometres for measurements?</dt>
    <dd>We use maps from the British national grid reference system, devised by Ordnance Survey. This measures distances in metres and kilometres rather than miles.</dd>

    <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
    <dd>We want to keep reports locally focused, so we restrict the ability to
    move radically between areas. The map on <a href="/my">Your Reports</a> will let you see all
    the reports you&rsquo;ve made, wherever they are.</dd>
